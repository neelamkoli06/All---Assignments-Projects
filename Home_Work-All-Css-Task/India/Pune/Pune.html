        sunny with dry heat. Early mornings are pleasant and evenings after six, cool and breezy. Pune stands on the leeward side of the Western Ghats on an altitude of 559m. (1863 ft.). Summers are typically hot with maximum temperatures ranging from

        cooler than most other parts in this region owing to its high altitude.</p>
